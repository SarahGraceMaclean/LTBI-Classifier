# LTBI-Classifier

To run the code:

- Open up the Colab notebook
- Run each cell individually
- If you would like to save the changes you make, save a copy in your own google drive (you will see an option for this in Colab)

File structure in Drive shoud be:
 - "Final Classifier 1" folder with a subfolder called "images"
 - In "images" there should be two folders "train" and "test"
 - In each of those folders there should be two more folders "positive" and "negative"
 - Those folders should contain the respective images
